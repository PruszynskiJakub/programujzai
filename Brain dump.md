Both "Task you must focus" and "You must focus on the task" convey a similar message, but they have different structures and slightly different emphasis. Here's a breakdown:

- **"Task you must focus"**: This is a more emphatic or poetic phrasing. It places the "task" in the prominent position at the beginning of the sentence. This construction highlights the _task itself_ as the primary focus. It's less common in everyday speech but can be used for dramatic effect. It sounds somewhat like Yoda from Star Wars.
    
- **"You must focus on the task"**: This is a more standard and direct sentence structure. The emphasis is more balanced between "you" and "the task." It's a clear instruction, directly telling the person what to do.

Take your time on examples do it extremely thoroughly
