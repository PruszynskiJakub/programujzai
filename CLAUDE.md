# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Obsidian vault containing educational content for an AI-assisted development course. The repository contains comprehensive materials about AI development tools, techniques, and workflows written in Polish.

## Repository Structure

### Core Course Content
- `Archive/course/` - Main course structure with modules covering AI development from beginner to advanced
- `course/modules/` - Individual course modules organized by difficulty level
- `course/notes/` - Supporting notes and concepts
- `course/prompt_library/` - Collection of reusable prompts for development tasks

### Knowledge Base
- `References/` - Structured information about AI tools, techniques, and concepts
- `Categories/` - Taxonomy system for organizing tools and concepts
- `Templates/` - Standardized templates for creating new content

### Content Types
The vault uses a structured approach with specific content categories:
- Tools (AI development tools and their capabilities)
- Techniques (Development methodologies and practices)
- Terms (Definitions and concepts)
- Prompts (Reusable prompt templates)
- Manuals (Step-by-step guides)

## Content Guidelines

### Language and Style
- **Content Language**: All content must be written in Polish
- **Writing Style**: Reflective, essay-like style similar to Paul Graham
- **Tone**: Use simple, direct explanations without unnecessary jargon
- **Structure**: Present ideas step-by-step, building on previous content

### Formatting Conventions
- Use `#`, `##`, `###` for hierarchy
- Use `[[Link Name]]` format for internal links
- Include appropriate code blocks and inline backticks
- Use emojis strategically to draw attention (ðŸš§ for work in progress, ðŸ¤– for AI-related content, etc.)
- Include both "how" and "why" explanations
- Address both benefits and limitations

### Content Development Rules
- Create smooth, conversational transitions between sections
- Pose questions to challenge assumptions
- Encourage reader interaction and suggestions
- Prioritize insights over quantity
- Include questions about implications

## Obsidian Configuration

The vault uses several plugins:
- `obsidian-git` - For version control integration
- `obsidian-local-images-plus` - For local image management

Key configuration files are in `.obsidian/` directory including workspace settings, appearance, and community plugins.

## Working with This Repository

### Content Creation
- Follow the template structure in `Templates/` directory
- Use the established category system in `Categories/`
- Reference existing content using the `[[Link]]` syntax
- Maintain the Polish language requirement for all content

### File Organization
- Course content follows a modular structure from basic to advanced topics
- Reference materials are categorized by type and linked appropriately
- Templates ensure consistency across content types

### Development Workflow
This repository represents an educational content development project rather than a traditional software project. When working with content:

1. Understand the course progression from basic AI tool usage to advanced development workflows
2. Maintain consistency with existing writing style and formatting
3. Use the established linking and categorization system
4. Follow the content guidelines defined in `.cursor/rules/lesson-rules.mdc`
