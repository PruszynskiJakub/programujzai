A clean sketch-pad style header illustration in a soft pastel palette (light teal, melon, lavender, ivory). The scene is framed by a thin hand-drawn border, as if on a notepad. Inside, low-poly 'sketches' of app screens, neural-net diagrams, and chat bubbles are arranged like overlapping sticky notes. In one corner sits a simple hand-drawn lightbulb with subtle low-poly facets. The overall look is playful yet modern, balancing rough pencil-style lines with crisp geometric shading against the pastel background.
