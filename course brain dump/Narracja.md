Like Neo, youâ€™ve felt it. Somethingâ€™s different about coding these days. AI tools and prompts dance at the edge of your consciousness - a white rabbit of possibility, beckoning.

Two paths lie before you:

ðŸ”´ Stay in familiar territory. Keep coding the way you always have. Safe. Predictable. Limited.

ðŸ”µ Follow the rabbit. Dive deep into AI-augmented development. Learn to bend the rules of productivity, master prompt engineering, and reshape whatâ€™s possible with code.

This course is your Morpheus. Weâ€™ll show you how deep the AI rabbit hole goes - from basic AI tools to advanced prompt engineering. Youâ€™ll emerge as a new kind of developer, fluent in both human and machine languages.

The choice is yours. But remember: in todayâ€™s rapidly evolving tech landscape, not choosing is also a choice
