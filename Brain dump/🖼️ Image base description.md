A clean sketch-pad style header illustration in a soft pastel palette (light teal, melon, lavender, ivory). The scene is framed by a thin hand-drawn border, as if on a notepad. Inside, low-poly 'sketches' of app screens, neural-net diagrams, and chat bubbles are arranged like overlapping sticky notes. In one corner sits a simple hand-drawn lightbulb with subtle low-poly facets. The overall look is playful yet modern, balancing rough pencil-style lines with crisp geometric shading against the pastel background.

- **Style:**
    
    - Hand-drawn **sketch-pad outlines**, but instead of pure black & white, the fills and accents are soft pastels:
        
        - **Light teal** for the AI assistant
            
        - **Melon** accents for the `.env` file
            
        - **Lavender** for background elements and speech bubbles
            
        - **Ivory** as the page / base background
            
    - Thin hand-drawn border, giving the sense of a comic note doodled on a notepad.
        
- **Scene:**
    
    - A vertical pole (ivory background, faint lavender shading).
        
    - On it, a taped-up **poster of a `.env` file** — anthropomorphized with **googly eyes**, pastel melon fill, sketchy lavender outline. It looks worried, beads of “sweat” doodled near its corner.
        
    - Below, the **AI assistant** stands in simple geometric form (a low-poly, teal pastel robot with round lavender eyes). It holds a rough magnifying glass, looking up at the `.env`.
        
- **Dialogue:**
    
    - From the `.env` poster:  
        _„Cholera, AI mnie szuka!”_ (in bold, playful pastel lavender bubble text).
        
    - From the AI assistant, in a tiny melon bubble with deadpan tone:  
        _„Found you.”_
        
- **Overall vibe:**  
    Playful, modern, pastel-doodle version of the minimalist humor strip. The pastel palette softens the sarcastic humor, making it feel like a **header illustration** that’s both witty and visually charming.


Dry, witty humor with a hint of absurdity
